#SNIFFER:

#Example of an Arduino sketch that captures Ethernet traffic using the ESP8266 and sends the captured packets to a remote server for analysis.

#This code configures the ESP8266 with a MAC address and connects to a remote server with the IP address of your_server. 

#The Ethernet.buffer(2048) function is used to set the buffer size for incoming packets. 

#The Ethernet.packetReceive() function is used to receive packets and the Ethernet.packetLoop(packetSize) function is used to process the received packets. 

#The captured packets are sent to the remote server using the client.write() function.

#You can also use ESP8266 to send the packets to a specific port for analysis or you can use a library like ESP8266Sniffer to sniff the packets.
